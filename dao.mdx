IndexMaker is a decentralized protocol designed to build and manage on-chain index portfolios.

While we are organized as a **Limited Liability Company (LLC) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands**, we are governed by a decentralized community. Our goal is operational efficiency and meritocracy, avoiding the centralization traps common in traditional organizations.

This document outlines how the **IndexMaker Master DAO LLC** and its associated Series operate.

## 1. Key Concepts & Definitions

Before diving into the rules, here are the core terms we use to run the DAO:

- **Sortition:** The process of randomly selecting people for governance roles. We use this to prove that management is "fungible" (replaceable) and doesn't rely on specific "special" individuals.
- **Goldilocks Algorithm:** A specific math formula we use to pick our supervisory committee. It balances fairness and security to ensure no one can game the system to guarantee they get picked.
- **Elected DAO:** The supervisory committee selected by the Goldilocks Algorithm. They oversee operations and Curators.
- **Curator:** The person or entity managing the strategy (methodology) of a specific Index Series.
- **Issuer Network:** The decentralized group of node operators that actually execute the transactions and enforce rules.

## 2. The General Assembly (Token Holders)

The General Assembly is the ultimate authority of the DAO. It consists of everyone holding Governance Tokens.

### Voting Power

- **Weight:** Your vote is weighted by the number of tokens you hold.
- **Staking:** Where applicable, voting power can also come from USDC deposited into the governance staking contract.

### Powers

The General Assembly holds the sovereign power to:

- **Change the Constitution:** Ratify or reject amendments to this document.
- **Manage the Network:** Elect or fire members of the Issuer Network.
- **Set Criteria:** Decide who is allowed into the "Eligibility Pool" for leadership roles.
- **The Nuclear Option:** Initiate a **"Vote of No Confidence"** to immediately dissolve the current Elected DAO and trigger a new random selection.

### Real Rights (Anti-Illusory Provision)

We are compliant with the principles of _Williamson v. Tucker_ and _SEC v. Merchant Capital_. This means your voting rights are real, not just for show. We guarantee:

- **Notice:** You will get detailed information and sufficient notice regarding proposals.
- **Neutrality:** Default voting rules will never favor the incumbent management.
- **Ability to Fire:** You have the practical ability to remove any Curator or Elected DAO member via a majority vote.

## 3. The Elected DAO & Goldilocks Sortition

The Elected DAO is a group of **15–20 members**.

**Important:** Their job is _not_ to create policy. Their job is to supervise execution, ensure Curators follow the rules, and instruct the Issuer Network on sensitive parameters.

### Getting into the "Eligibility Pool"

To be eligible for the Elected DAO, you must be admitted to the pool by meeting three requirements:

- **Proof of Skill:** Pass the Governance and Compliance Certification (covering smart contract safety, financial risk, and regulations).
- **Stake at Risk:** Deposit collateral. If you act maliciously, you lose this money (slashing).
- **Identity Verification:** You must prove your identity for legal accountability, though you may remain pseudonymous to the public where allowed.

### The Selection Process (Goldilocks Mechanism)

We don't hold popularity contests. We select the Elected DAO from the pool using the **Goldilocks Algorithm**:

- **Fairness:** Every qualified member has a real, non-negligible chance of being picked. No exclusionary cliques allowed.
- **Manipulation Resistant:** The algorithm caps the maximum probability of selection. This stops "Sybil attacks" (one person pretending to be many) or gaming the criteria.
- **Verifiable:** The selection happens on-chain using a **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** so anyone can audit the results.

### Terms & Limits

- **Fixed Term:** Members serve for a set period (e.g., 6 months).
- **No Incumbency:** Once a term ends, a new Sortition event happens. Consecutive terms are prohibited to prevent power entrenchment.

## 4. Series Governance & Curators

The Master DAO can create new "Series" for each Index Token. Legally, each Series is a **distinct liability cell**.

### The Curator Role

Each Series is managed by a Curator.

- **Responsibility:** They propose the basket of assets and rebalancing weights based on the Index Methodology.
- **Selection:** Any Member can propose a Curator, but they must be approved by the Elected DAO.
- **Removal:** Curators serve at the pleasure of the DAO. They can be removed by a General Assembly vote or by the Elected DAO (for cause).

### Safety Limitations

To keep funds safe, **Curators never have custody of assets.**

- They can only submit "rebalancing proposals" to the smart contract.
- These proposals are validated by the Issuer Network against pre-defined logic.
- If the proposal violates the methodology, it is rejected. A Curator cannot misappropriate funds.

## 5. The Issuer Network

The Issuer Network is the technical execution layer, made up of independent validator nodes elected by the General Assembly.

### Responsibilities

- **Execution:** They cryptographically sign and execute transactions approved by governance.
- **Compliance Guardrails:** They are mandated to block any transaction that violates the Protocol's **"Blacklist"** (OFAC sanctions) or **"Hard Cap"** (risk limits).

### Random Leader Election

To prevent collusion, no single node is always in charge. For every epoch, we use a **Random Leader Election** process to decide which node proposes the block or executes the batch of transactions.
